# DEMO-inksansGMS2
The inksansGMS2 project downloaded from `ZeroXilo` that has not been changed since March 28, 2019.<br />
There are tons of bugs.<br />
For the project itself, in the version `below` GMS2 `2.3`, there will be a huge number of bugs due to its transformation from `GameMaker 8.0 Pro`;<br />
it will not run at all in GMS2 `2.3` and `above`, because the number of bugs doubled.<br />
从前作者`调零修罗`那里下载来的自2019.3.28就没有更新过的inksansGMS2工程文件，也就是我开始修复和更新的工程。<br />
成吨的bug警告，根本`无法运行`。<br />
对于工程本身而言，它在GMS2 `2.3 以下`的版本中，由于它从`GameMaker 8.0 专业版`转型，所以会有巨量的bug；<br />
在GMS2 `2.3 及以上`版本中根本无法运行，因为bug数量翻了一倍。<br />
